# lwext4 -- defects found, and the patches that fix them

This document lists every defect found in **lwext4**
(`https://github.com/gkostka/lwext4`, Grzegorz Kostka and contributors,
BSD licence) while it was used as the ext2 / ext3 / ext4 library of
BifrostFM, and every change made to lwext4's own sources to fix them. Each
patch is explained -- the defect, how it was shown, the fix -- and given as
a unified diff against the upstream release it was made on.

- **Part 1** gives the patches, one section each, with its diff.
- **Part 2** lists defects found and verified -- by a test, or by reading
  the code where a test cannot reach them -- that are NOT fixed here.
- **Part 3** lists upstream's open issues that are not lwext4 defects.

## The base: release v1.0.0, and what master already has

The copy was taken from upstream's **v1.0.0 release tag** (commit
`890484c`, 2016-02-09). Every diff below is against v1.0.0, and every
patch applies to it: each patch's hunks were checked with `git apply
--check` against a clean v1.0.0 tree, one patch at a time, and all 50
apply.

Upstream's **master** branch is 150 commits later (`58bcf89`,
2022-09-22, the newest). All 112 of those commits that touch the library
(`src/`, `include/`) were read against these patches, so each patch section
says where master stands:

- **fixed in master** -- a master commit fixes the same defect (named); the
  patch is not needed on master;
- **partly fixed in master** -- a master commit fixes part of it, and what
  is left is said;
- **not fixed in master** -- master still has the defect, checked in
  master's own code.

Each section also says whether its hunks apply to master as they stand
(`git apply --check`), only with fuzz (`patch -F2 --dry-run`, every hunk
placed), or how many hunks fail there and would need adapting, because
master's code has moved.

One more fact about master for anyone taking these into it: master commit
`b1a34c5` relicensed master's xattr and extent code as GPL.

Upstream has been quiet: the newest pull request reviewed is #176
(2026-10-16).

---

## How to read the patches

- Each hunk is unified diff with two lines of context, lwext4's own paths
  (`a/src/ext4.c`, `b/src/ext4.c`), and the function it is in after the
  second `@@`. The upstream line numbers are v1.0.0's; the changed-side
  numbers are those of v1.0.0 with only that patch applied.
- The changed code is marked in the source with its patch number
  ("BifrostFM patch N"), so `grep "BifrostFM patch"` over the copy finds
  every site; the comments in the hunks are the patch's own.
- A hunk that carries the changes of two patches is shown once, under the
  first, and named under the other ("Also this patch's ...").
- A few patches build on others, and compile only with them: patches 7 and 8
  need the files they add (below); patch 9 matters only once patches 3, 5,
  7 or 8 widen the features lwext4 mounts; patch 41 calls patch 38's
  recount; patch 45's revoke cancel looks in patch 51's revoke tree, and the
  hunk shown under patch 46 also defines that tree's functions.
- **Shown** means a test showed the defect -- a test image made by
  e2fsprogs (`mke2fs`, `debugfs`), the operation run through lwext4, and the
  result judged by e2fsprogs (`e2fsck -fn`, `debugfs`) -- failing before the
  patch and passing after it. **By reading** means the fault was found and
  fixed from the code alone, no test being able to reach it.
- Patch 11 is not in this list: it changed e2fsprogs, not lwext4.

**Files added.** Patches 7 and 8 add whole files, which are not reproduced
here -- they are in BifrostFM's source release, beside lwext4's own, under
`engine/lwext4/`:

| File | Lines | Patch | Licence |
|---|---|---|---|

| `include/ext4_casefold.h`, `src/ext4_casefold.c` | 155, 212 | 8 | GPL-2.0-or-later (BifrostFM's) |
| `unicode/nls_utf8.c`, `unicode/utf8n.h`, `unicode/utf8data.h` | 1 015, 120, 4 109 | 8 | e2fsprogs 1.47.4's Unicode folding, mirrored verbatim bar one exported wrapper (`ext2fs_casefold`, marked); GNU GPL, as their headers state |
| `unicode/config.h`, `unicode/ext2_fs.h`, `unicode/ext2fs.h`, `unicode/ext2fsP.h` | 23, 34, 117, 58 | 8 | GPL-2.0-or-later (BifrostFM's): stand-ins that let `nls_utf8.c` build without e2fsprogs |

None of these is covered by lwext4's BSD licence.

## Part 1 -- the patches

### Patch 1 -- out of space while appending to an extent file never returns

**Where:** `src/ext4_fs.c`, `ext4_fs_append_inode_dblk`, the extent branch.

**The defect:** the result of `ext4_extent_get_blocks` was not looked at
before `ext4_assert(*fblock)`. On a full filesystem the call fails, the
block is 0, the assertion fails -- and lwext4's default `ext4_assert`
prints and then loops for ever. Had it returned, the inode's size would also
have been grown for a block never allocated. ext2 and ext3 (no extents)
return ENOSPC as they should.

**Shown:** a 20 MiB file written into a 16 MiB ext4 image spun at 100 % CPU
until killed, at 1 and 4 KiB blocks (a debugger showed `ext4_fwrite` ->
`ext4_fs_append_inode_dblk`). Patched, the write fails with ENOSPC, and
images filled to their last block are `e2fsck -fn` clean.

**The fix:** the failure is returned before the assertion and before the
size is grown. (The same hunk carries patch 36's change to that assertion.)

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `ab4ac25` (2016-02-18). Its hunk applies
to master only with fuzz, and is not needed there.

```
<!-- /hunks -->

### Patch 2 -- a failed write leaves the device's write-back count raised

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `ext4_fwrite`.

**The defect:** `ext4_fwrite` starts write-back cache mode near its top,
and two failure exits -- appending a block fails (ENOSPC), or a block-map
initialisation fails -- jump past the matching stop. The block device's
`cache_write_back` count stays one too high for as long as the device
object lives, so a later write-back "off" no longer flushes anything.

**Shown:** in one process, after a write failed for lack of space, an image
then formatted with `ext4_mkfs` reached the disk WITHOUT its root directory
(`e2fsck`: "Root inode is not a directory"), because the formatter's own
write-back "off" no longer flushed its cache. Patched, the format is clean.

**The fix:** both exits stop write-back mode before they leave.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master; applies to master.

<!-- /hunks -->

### Patch 3 -- `metadata_csum_seed` is refused

**Where:** `include/ext4_types.h` (the superblock struct, the supported
set), `include/ext4_super.h`, and every metadata checksum seed in
`ext4_balloc.c`, `ext4_dir.c`, `ext4_dir_idx.c`, `ext4_extent.c`,
`ext4_fs.c` (two), `ext4_ialloc.c`, `ext4_xattr.c`.

**The defect:** e2fsprogs 1.43 onward sets the incompatible feature
`metadata_csum_seed` (0x2000, which lwext4 names `BG_USE_META_CSUM`) by
default with `metadata_csum`, so every recent image -- current Raspberry Pi
OS among them -- carries it. lwext4 lists it as unsupported, so the mount
fails with ENOTSUP. With the feature, every metadata checksum is seeded from
the superblock's stored `s_checksum_seed` (offset 0x270) rather than from
crc32c of the uuid, and lwext4's struct had that word inside its padding.

**Shown:** a Raspberry Pi OS root partition, refused before, mounted with
the patch, was browsed and its files read; the ordinary test images stayed
`e2fsck` clean.

**The fix:** the superblock gains `prj_quota_inum` and `checksum_seed`
(out of the padding, same size); `EXT4_FINCOM_CSUM_SEED` joins the
supported set; a new `ext4_sb_csum_seed()` returns the stored seed when the
feature is set and crc32c(uuid) otherwise, and replaces the eight seed
computations. The journal's own checksums (the jbd2 superblock's uuid) are
untouched.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master. 2 of its 12 hunks need adapting to
master; the rest apply.

### Patch 4 -- a refused mount keeps its mount point

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `ext4_mount` (every failure exit after the mount
point is claimed) and `ext4_umount`.

**The defect:** `ext4_mount` claims a slot -- `mounted = 1` and the name --
before it opens the device and reads the superblock. When a later step
fails (not an ext filesystem, a damaged superblock, an unsupported
feature) it returns with the slot still claimed. The next `ext4_mount` of
the same name finds the slot and returns EOK at once, opening nothing: every
read then fails with EIO, and `ext4_umount` calls
`ext4_bcache_cleanup(NULL)` and crashes. The block-size-mismatch exit also
left the device open and a dynamic cache allocated.

**Shown:** a zero-filled file mounted twice: the second mount "succeeded"
and the unmount crashed with an access violation. Patched, both mounts are
refused, and a good image then mounts, lists and unmounts.

**The fix:** each failure exit gives the mount point back (`mounted = 0`,
the name cleared); the size-mismatch exit also releases the cache and
closes the device; `ext4_umount` refuses (ENODEV) a mount point that is not
mounted or has no cache, so a future slip is an error, not a crash.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `ce13c49`. 1 of its 4 hunks fails on
master, and it is not needed there.

### Patch 5 -- `largedir` is refused, and a split index node gets the wrong limit on metadata_csum

**Where:** `include/ext4_types.h`, `include/ext4_dir_idx.h`,
`src/ext4_inode.c` (`ext4_inode_get_size`), `src/ext4_dir_idx.c`
(`ext4_dir_hinfo_init`, both path arrays, `ext4_dir_dx_split_index`,
`ext4_dir_dx_add_entry`).

**The defect:** two. (1) `largedir` (0x4000) allows an htree of three
levels and a directory size that uses `size_hi`. lwext4 refused the
feature, and its depth check, its two-element path arrays and its split
code (which handled only a full root and a full level-one node, ENOSPC
otherwise) could not read or grow such a tree. (2) A defect WITHOUT
largedir, on every metadata_csum filesystem: `ext4_dir_dx_split_index`
gave a new index node the limit (block - 8) / 8, forgetting the 8-byte
checksum tail, while `ext4_dir_dx_get_leaf` checks every node against
(block - 16) / 8 -- so the first index node lwext4 split was refused by
lwext4 itself on the next walk (it then clears the directory's index flag
and searches linearly), and the Linux driver reports "dx entry: limit
mismatch". One error exit of `ext4_dir_dx_add_entry` also released a block
it had never taken.

**Shown:** lwext4 filled an empty large_dir image's directory with 70 000
entries of 250-byte names; `e2fsck -fn` found the three-level tree clean.
After `e2fsck -D` re-indexed it, lwext4 read it back (lookups at both ends,
a missing name, the full listing), added 3 000 directories through index
splits at depth, removed 1 500, and `e2fsck` was clean again.

**The fix:** largedir joins the supported set; `EXT4_HTREE_LEVEL_COMPAT`
(2) and `EXT4_HTREE_LEVEL` (3) and `ext4_dir_dx_htree_level()` as the Linux
driver has them size the depth check and both path arrays; a directory's
size takes `size_hi` with largedir; `ext4_dir_dx_split_index` is rewritten
on the driver's method -- walk up from the full leaf index node to the
nearest ancestor with room, split the node below it, or add a level under
the root when all are full and the tree may grow (ENOSPC before anything is
allocated when it may not) -- and returns EAGAIN, so
`ext4_dir_dx_add_entry` releases its path and walks the tree again. A new
node's limit allows for the checksum tail.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master -- master still has no largedir, and its
split still computes the limit before subtracting the tail. 1 of its 9
hunks needs adapting to master.

### Patch 6 -- a read-only session dirties block groups, and a failed block get crashes the next release

**Where:** `src/ext4_fs.c` (`ext4_fs_get_block_group_ref`),
`src/ext4_blockdev.c` (`ext4_block_get_noread`), `src/ext4_extent.c`
(`read_extent_tree_block`).

**The defect:** `ext4_fs_get_block_group_ref` initialises an uninitialised
group's bitmaps (and zeroes its inode table) the first time the group is
touched -- on a READ-ONLY mount too -- leaving the bitmap and descriptor
blocks dirty in the cache, where a read-only device can never flush them.
Once they fill the cache, a block get has to shake it, the flush fails, and
`ext4_block_get_noread` had already set the caller's `lb_id` with no
buffer; `read_extent_tree_block` then released "what it got" on the
strength of `lb_id`, and `ext4_block_set`'s assertion on the missing buffer
spins for ever.

**Shown:** a read-only session that looked at files in two uninitialised
groups, then looked up names through a three-level directory with an
extent index block, spun at 100 % CPU on the fifth lookup (found with a
debugger). Patched, the lookups pass.

**The fix:** a read-only filesystem returns before the lazy
initialisation (the bitmaps are only for allocation); a failed get clears
`lb_id`, `buf` and `data`; `read_extent_tree_block` releases a block only
when it holds a buffer.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master; applies to master.

### Patch 7 -- `inline_data` is refused (a feature added)

**Where:** the new `include/ext4_inline.h` and `src/ext4_inline.c`, with
hooks in `ext4_types.h`, `ext4_dir.h`, `ext4_dir.c`, `ext4.c` and
`ext4_fs.c`.

**The defect:** `mke2fs -O inline_data` keeps small files and directories
inside the inode -- 60 bytes in `i_block`, the rest in the inode body's
"system.data" attribute. lwext4 refuses the feature; were it allowed
without this patch, every block-map walk would read `i_block` as block
numbers: a read would return garbage and a remove would FREE whatever
blocks the content's bytes named.

**The design:** inline content is read in place; an inline directory is
laid out in memory as the one block it would become, so the lookup,
listing and emptiness code run over it unchanged; any write first converts
the inode to a block-backed one, as the Linux driver does when inline
content outgrows the inode. Nothing is ever written inline. The block is
allocated and filled while the inode is still inline, and attached only
then, so a full filesystem or an I/O error cannot leave the inode emptied.

**Shown:** an image made with `mke2fs -O inline_data -I 256` holding files
of 0, 10, 60 and 120 bytes and a three-file directory: sizes, lookups, the
listing and exact reads; then a rename, a create and a mkdir in the
directory, the 120-byte file overwritten with 200 bytes, the 60-byte file
removed -- `e2fsck -fn` clean, the untouched file still inline. Damaged
inline inodes were refused rather than overrun: a size of 2^64 - 1 no
longer wraps the buffer's allocation, an inline directory's entries are
held to the block, and a name added to an inline directory on a full
filesystem leaves its entries whole.

**The fix:** as designed above. Dropping an inline inode whose
"system.data" is missing is allowed (lwext4's removal answers ENOENT for
it, not ENODATA), so a damaged inode can be removed.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master (master lists inline_data among the
features to implement). 1 of its 21 hunks needs adapting to master.

### Patch 8 -- `casefold` is refused (a feature added)

**Where:** the new `include/ext4_casefold.h`, `src/ext4_casefold.c` and
`unicode/` (above), with hooks in `ext4_types.h`, `ext4_hash.h`,
`ext4_hash.c`, `ext4_dir_idx.c`, `ext4_dir.h`, `ext4_dir.c`, `ext4_fs.c`
and `ext4.c`.

**The defect:** on a `mke2fs -O casefold` filesystem (Linux 5.2 onward) a
directory with the casefold flag is case-insensitive: the kernel hashes
and compares its names by their FOLDED form (Unicode NFD and full case
folding under the superblock's encoding, UTF-8 12.1), while the entries
keep their bytes. lwext4 refuses the feature; were it allowed without this
patch, a lookup by another case would miss, and an entry added to an
indexed casefolded directory would be hashed by its raw bytes and placed
where the kernel never looks.

**The design:** the folding is e2fsprogs' own code and tables, so the
forms are the kernel's; the new module decides when to fold (the flag on
the directory, the feature and a known encoding on the filesystem) and
compares (the looked-up name folded once per block, each entry folded and
compared byte for byte; a name that is not valid UTF-8 is hashed and
compared raw, the kernel's non-strict fallback). A directory made inside a
casefolded one inherits the flag. A filesystem with an unknown encoding is
refused.

**Shown:** an image with a casefolded `/ci` and an ordinary `/plain`:
lookups by other cases (STRASSE finding the sharp s), the root and `/plain`
still case-sensitive, stored spellings listed; then 300 links put through
`/ci`'s htree and found by any case, creates onto other cases refused, a
rename and a remove by another case. `e2fsck -fn` is CLEAN on the index
lwext4 built -- it checks every entry of a casefolded htree against the
folded hash, so that is the proof the hashes are the kernel's.

**The fix:** as designed above. The superblock gains `encoding` /
`encoding_flags` (with the high time bytes and `orphan_file_inum` before
them, out of the padding); the htree hash takes a folded name up to 4096
bytes, where it capped at 255.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master. 1 of its 26 hunks needs adapting to
master.

### Patch 9 -- the formatter stamps every feature lwext4 can mount

**Where:** `src/ext4_mkfs.c`, `ext4_mkfs`, the ext4 case.

**The defect:** a new ext4 filesystem's incompatible features were
`EXT4_SUPPORTED_FINCOM` -- the set lwext4 can MOUNT, which in v1.0.0
happens to equal what the formatter lays out. Any change that widens the
supported set (patches 3, 5, 7, 8) widens what a fresh image is stamped
with: `csum_seed` without `metadata_csum` is a superblock e2fsck reports,
and casefold would promise an encoding the superblock does not carry. The
set also outgrows the formatter's 16-bit field, which gcc's overflow
warning is how this was noticed.

**Shown:** the formatter's 1-40 MiB sweep, every image `e2fsck -fn` clean.

**The fix:** the ext4 case names what the formatter lays out: `filetype`,
`extents`, `64bit`.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master (latent there, as in v1.0.0); applies to
master.

### Patch 10 -- `fast_commit` is not named

**Where:** `include/ext4_types.h`.

**What it is:** one define, `EXT4_FCOM_FAST_COMMIT` (0x0400), so a caller
can see the compatible feature and refuse to write after an unclean
shutdown. lwext4 neither honours nor replays the journal's fast-commit area
-- that defect is NOT fixed here (Part 2).

### Patch 12 -- a symlink of 60 bytes or more is written over the start of the filesystem

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `ext4_fsymlink_set` and `ext4_fsymlink`.

**The defect:** four in one path. (1) A target too long for the inode gets
a data block allocated -- and is then written with
`ext4_block_writebytes(bdev, 0, buf, size)`: at byte 0 of the FILESYSTEM.
The boot area is overwritten every time, and past 1 KiB the superblock;
the link's own block keeps whatever it held, so the link reads back empty
and `e2fsck` calls it invalid. (2) The length test was `size >
block_size`, so a target exactly one block long was accepted, which
`e2fsck` calls invalid. (3) That test ran after the inode and its entry
were created, so a refused link was left behind empty; and the failure
exits after write-back mode started skipped its stop (patch 2's shape).
(4) A link over a name already taken was not refused: over a link its text
was silently replaced, over a file or directory the answer was ENOENT.
`symlink(2)` refuses all three with EEXIST.

**Shown:** ext4 at 4 and 1 KiB, ext3 at 2 KiB and ext2 at 1 KiB, links of
59, 60 and 1024 bytes, a block less one, and a whole block, copies of the
long ones, and links over a file, a directory and a link. Unpatched, every
long link read back as 0 bytes, the boot area changed on all four images,
the target text sat at byte 2048 of the 4 KiB image, the whole-block link
was accepted, and `e2fsck -fn` reported every long link invalid. Patched,
all pass, `e2fsck -fn` is clean and `debugfs` reads every link back
identical.

**The fix:** `ext4_fsymlink` refuses a target of a block or more (EINVAL)
and a name that exists (EEXIST) before it creates anything;
`ext4_fsymlink_set` tests `size >= block_size` and writes the text into the
allocated block -- the whole block, the rest zeroed, DIRECTLY to the
device, as `ext4_fwrite` writes file data -- and every failure leaves
through the write-back stop. Not through the block cache: `ext4_fread`,
which `ext4_readlink` uses, reads data blocks directly, so a block still
dirty in the cache reads back as what the disk held (with a large cache,
every long link made in a session came back empty).

**Upstream:** partly fixed in master: `c5f8d13` writes the target into the
link's own block (1), leaving the rest of that block as it was; (2), (3)
and (4) remain. 2 of its 3 hunks need adapting to master.

### Patch 13 -- removing a directory tree frees a file that still has another name outside it

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `ext4_dir_rm`, the per-entry loop.

**The defect:** every non-directory in the tree was truncated, its link
count forced to 0 and its inode freed, whatever its link count. A hard link
from outside the tree is left naming a freed inode: the file reads as
empty, and `e2fsck` reports "has deleted/unused inode".

**Shown:** ext3 at 4, 2 and 1 KiB and ext4 at 4 KiB, a file in a tree with a
hard link outside it, the tree removed: unpatched, `e2fsck` failed on all
four; patched, all clean and the outside name intact.

**The fix:** as `ext4_fremove` does it -- truncate only when this is the
file's last name, let `ext4_unlink` take one link away, and free the inode
only when none is left. A directory is still removed whole.

**Upstream:** pull request #148 (open). Not fixed in master; applies to
master.

### Patch 14 -- a moved small directory's block checksum is left wrong

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `ext4_link`, the branch that rewrites ".." in a
directory without an htree index.

**The defect:** ".." is rewritten in place and the block marked dirty, but
its checksum is not recomputed. lwext4 makes its own new directories
indexed, but Linux and e2fsprogs leave small directories unindexed, so
moving ANY small directory Linux made, on a metadata_csum filesystem, left
a block `e2fsck` reports as failing its checksum and Linux will not read.

**Shown:** ext4 images at 1 and 4 KiB made by `mke2fs -d` with 40 small
directories, each moved to a new parent: unpatched, `e2fsck` reported the
checksum error on every moved directory; patched, clean.

**The fix:** `ext4_dir_set_csum` before the block is marked dirty.

**Upstream:** pull request #132 (open). Not fixed in master; applies to
master.

### Patch 15 -- a sparse file's holes are read from block 0

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `ext4_fread`, the whole-block loop and the
trailing partial block.

**The defect:** the loop gathered runs of consecutive physical blocks and
never tested for 0, which is how a hole is recorded: a hole was read from
block 0 of the filesystem, and the runs after it were mis-tracked. The
trailing block had the same fault. Reading a sparse file gives wrong
content.

**Shown:** a file of 4 KiB of A, an 8 KiB hole, 4 KiB of B and a hole to
32 KiB (`mke2fs -d` keeps the holes), read back at 1 and 4 KiB blocks:
unpatched wrong, patched exact.

**The fix:** each block is looked up; a hole is a block of zeros; a real
block starts a run of consecutive ones, read directly in one call as
before; the tail reads zeros for a hole too.

**Upstream:** pull request #103, issue #101. Partly fixed in master: its
leading partial block reads a hole as zeros, while the whole-block loop and
the tail still read block 0. 2 of its 3 hunks need adapting to master.

### Patch 16 -- creating anything hangs when a group's free-inode count is wrong

**Where:** `src/ext4_ialloc.c`, `ext4_ialloc_alloc_inode`.

**The defect:** when a group's free count claims inodes its bitmap does not
have, the branch does `continue` without `++bgid`, so the same group is
tried for ever -- exactly what a damaged or interrupted filesystem has.

**Shown:** `mke2fs -t ext4 -b 1024 -N 16` with every inode used, then
`debugfs` setting group 0's free inode count to 2 (checksum recalculated):
one mkdir hung until killed; patched, it fails with ENOSPC at once.

**The fix:** `++bgid` before that `continue`.

### Patch 21 -- a checksummed journal's commit blocks and tags are written in the wrong byte order

**Where:** `src/ext4_journal.c`: `jbd_commit_csum_set`, `jbd_block_csum`,
`jbd_block_tag_csum_set`.

**The defect:** on a journal with checksum v2 or v3 -- which the Linux
driver turns on for every metadata_csum filesystem, so nearly every modern
one -- the commit block's checksum was stored in host order (jbd2, and
lwext4's own verifier, read it big-endian), the tag checksum hashed the
sequence number in host order, and a v2 tag kept the wrong 16 bits. After a
crash between a commit and its checkpoint, e2fsck and Linux report "Journal
transaction N was corrupt, replay was aborted", and lwext4's own recovery
rejects its own commit block, replays nothing, and clears needs_recovery.

**Shown:** an ext4 image whose journal was switched to checksum v3
(`debugfs`, `jo -c -v 3`), written by lwext4 and then set back to a pending
replay of its last transaction, with one directory block zeroed in place:
unpatched, `e2fsck` "transaction 1 was corrupt" and lwext4's replay left
the directory corrupt; patched, both replays restore it and the image is
clean. A control without metadata_csum passes either way.

**The fix:** `to_be32` on the commit checksum; the sequence hashed as
`to_be32(sequence)`; a v2 tag `to_be16((uint16_t)checksum)`.

**Upstream:** pull request #164 (open). Not fixed in master; applies to
master. Beside it, NOT changed: the v1 checksum branch (Part 2).

### Patch 22 -- transaction IDs restart at 1 at every journal start

**Where:** `src/ext4_journal.c`: `jbd_journal_start`, `jbd_journal_stop`,
`jbd_recover`.

**The defect:** every journal start wrote the log from its first block with
IDs 1, 2, 3 ..., over the previous cycle's blocks; a stop wrote the
journal superblock's sequence as 0; a recovery left the sequence where it
was. After a crash right after a commit, a replay could run on into an OLD
cycle's transaction that carried the next expected ID and began where the
next transaction would have -- stale metadata applied over newer. Repeating
the same kind of change makes equal-sized transactions, so the alignment is
not far-fetched. (On a checksummed journal patch 21's defect hid this:
nothing was replayed at all.)

**Shown:** with patch 21's run, the journal sequence after a session was 0
unpatched and continued across cycles patched, and the replays pass with
continued IDs.

**The fix:** a start takes its first ID from the superblock's sequence (1
when 0); a stop writes the next unused ID as the sequence; a recovery
writes the last replayed ID + 1 -- as jbd2 does.

**Upstream:** pull request #114, issue #86 (the PR's hunks do not apply to
v1.0.0 as they stand). Partly fixed in master: `1a96ef0` takes a start's ID
from the sequence + 1, and the recovery records the last ID -- but master's
stop still writes the sequence as 0, so after every clean stop the next
start is back at ID 1, and the defect stands. 1 of its 3 hunks needs
adapting to master.

### Patch 23 -- meta_bg groups read their descriptors from the wrong block

**Where:** `src/ext4_fs.c`, `ext4_fs_get_descriptor_block`.

**The defect:** with meta_bg, a meta-group's descriptor block lives in its
FIRST group (after that group's superblock backup, if any); lwext4 looked
in group `bgid` itself, so every other group's bitmaps and counts were read
from, and written to, some other block.

**Shown:** a 64 MiB ext4 made with `-b 1024 -O meta_bg,^resize_inode`
(eight groups, one meta-group): unpatched, a copy that overwrote a file
lost it, and `e2fsck` found "Group 1 block(s) in use but group is marked
BLOCK_UNINIT"; patched, clean.

**The fix:** compute from group `dsc_id * dsc_per_block`, as the kernel's
`descriptor_loc()` does.

**Upstream:** pull request #166 (open). Not fixed in master; applies to
master.

### Patch 24 -- a fast symlink with an xattr block is taken for a slow one

**Where:** a new `ext4_inode_is_fast_symlink` in `src/ext4_inode.c`
(declared in `include/ext4_inode.h`), used by `ext4_fread` and
`ext4_fs_truncate_inode`.

**The defect:** lwext4 called a symlink fast only when its block count was
0, so a fast symlink with an xattr BLOCK (SELinux labels on 128-byte
inodes, say) was taken for a slow one: readlink failed, and REMOVING it
hung, walking the target text as a block map.

**Shown:** such a symlink: unpatched, the read failed and the remove hung;
patched, both work and `e2fsck` is clean.

**The fix:** the Linux driver's rule -- the block count less the xattr
block (one cluster with bigalloc) is 0.

**Upstream:** issue #108. Not fixed in master (it still tests a block
count of 0). 1 of its 4 hunks needs adapting to master.

**Where:** `src/ext4_inode.c`, `ext4_inode_get_uid` / `set_uid` /
`get_gid` / `set_gid`.

**The defect:** the high halves (in `osd2`, at the same offset in the Linux

0 -- root -- and setting 70000 stored 4464.

### Patch 26 -- an all-zero directory hash seed is used as given

**Where:** `src/ext4_hash.c`, `ext2_htree_hash`.

**The defect:** an all-zero seed means "no seed" to the Linux driver and
e2fsprogs (the default constants are used); lwext4 used the zeros. On such
a filesystem names Linux had filed were not found, and names lwext4 added
broke the hash order.

**Shown:** an image with a zero seed: unpatched, a name Linux filed was not
found and `e2fsck` reported a bad max hash; patched, found and clean.

**The fix:** a seed of all zeros is not copied in.

**Upstream:** issue #135. Not fixed in master; applies to master.

### Patch 27 -- the superblock's geometry is not bounded

**Where:** `src/ext4_super.c`, `ext4_sb_check`.

**The defect:** the block size, 64bit descriptor size, blocks (or clusters)
and inodes per group, inode size and first data block were not checked, so
a damaged or crafted image opened -- and then divided by zero (#174, #90)
or overran its bitmaps (#93, part of #172).

**Shown:** two damaged superblocks (an impossible descriptor size, an
impossible group size) opened unpatched; patched, both are refused.

**The fix:** the Linux driver's limits: the block size at most 64 KiB;
64bit descriptors at least 64 bytes and a power of two; blocks (clusters
with bigalloc) and inodes per group at most one bitmap block's worth; the
inode size at most a block and a power of two; the first data block inside
the filesystem.

**Upstream:** issues #165, #111, #96, #174, #93, #90. Not fixed in master;
applies to master.

filesystem of 2^32 blocks or more an xattr block above that was looked for
in the wrong place. By reading. (The upstream pull request's own fix shifts
a 32-bit value by 32, which is undefined.)

### Patch 30 -- a failed htree walk leaks its blocks, and the add-entry caller releases wild

**Where:** `src/ext4_dir_idx.c`: `ext4_dir_dx_get_leaf`, its two callers,
and a new `ext4_dir_dx_release_walk`.

**The defect:** a failed walk (a damaged index node, an I/O error)
returned holding every level it had loaded; the lookup caller released one
and leaked the rest, and the add-entry caller released `dx_blks` up to a
`dx_blk` the walk sets only on success: a loop over stack garbage.

**Shown:** an indexed directory whose index root count was zeroed, then a
mkdir and a lookup in it: it did not crash unpatched in this build (the
undefined pointer happened to stop the loop), so the fix is by reading;
patched, both behave and a 3-level, 71 500-entry directory still checks
clean.

**The fix:** the walk releases everything it holds on every failure exit,
and the callers release nothing after a failed walk.

**Upstream:** pull request #133 (open). Not fixed in master; applies to
master.

### Patch 31 -- removing a file frees a SHARED xattr block

**Where:** `src/ext4_fs.c`, `ext4_fs_free_inode`, and a new
`ext4_xattr_block_drop_ref` in `src/ext4_xattr.c` (declared in
`include/ext4_xattr.h`).

**The defect:** the Linux driver gives inodes with identical attributes one
xattr block and counts them in `h_refcount`; lwext4 freed the block
whatever the count, so it was reused while other files still pointed at it.

**Shown:** 128-byte inodes, `/a`'s xattr block shared with `/b`
(`h_refcount` 2), `/a` removed: unpatched, `e2fsck` "Extended attribute
block has reference count 2, should be 1"; patched, clean, `/b` keeps the
block with a count of 1.

**The fix:** a shared block has its count lowered and is re-signed; only
the last user's departure frees it.

**Upstream:** no issue found. Not fixed in master (its inode free still
frees the block unconditionally); applies to master with fuzz.

### Patch 32 -- extent headers are not bounded, and the root header is never checked

**Where:** `src/ext4_extent.c`: `ext4_ext_check` and the start of
`ext4_find_extent`.

**The defect:** `eh_max` was never compared with what the node can hold,
the depth never bounded, and the root header in the inode never checked,
so a damaged or crafted header sent the searches past their buffers; and an
extent block failing its checksum was used anyway.

**Shown:** a file whose root header claims 255 entries of a maximum of
65 535: reading it is refused, read-only and writable, with the file beside
it still whole -- on the patched library only.

**The fix:** as the Linux driver's `__ext4_ext_check`: `eh_max` at most
what the node holds, depth at most 5, the root checked at the start of
every `ext4_find_extent` (it has no checksum tail). A failed extent-block
checksum REFUSES the block on a writable mount and is only logged on a
read-only one, so a damaged card stays readable for rescue.

**Upstream:** pull request #107, issues #100, #91. Not fixed in master;
applies to master with fuzz.

### Patch 33 -- the formatter's inodes per group is not a multiple of 8

**Where:** `src/ext4_mkfs.c`, `compute_inodes_per_group`.

**The defect:** the count was aligned only to the inodes one table block
holds -- 4 at 1 KiB blocks of 256-byte inodes -- so it could be a multiple
of 4 and not of 8. The last byte of each group's inode bitmap then holds
inodes and padding together, and e2fsck reports "Padding at end of inode
bitmap is not set" on a filesystem nothing has touched since it was made.

**Shown:** the 1-40 MiB sweep at 1 KiB blocks failed at 17, 20, 23, 33, 36
and 38 MiB, and 100 MiB (1972 per group), for every type; patched, every
image is clean.

**The fix:** round down to a multiple of 8 (at least 8), as e2fsprogs'
formatter does.

**Upstream:** no issue found. Not fixed in master; applies to master.

### Patch 34 -- a damaged xattr set releases the inode's block twice

**Where:** `src/ext4_xattr.c`, `ext4_fs_get_xattr_ref`.

**The defect:** when parsing the attribute set fails, the error path
released `inode_ref->block` -- the inode's own block, which the caller
releases again -- instead of the xattr block it had just taken. The second
release fails the block cache's assertion, which spins for ever.

**Shown:** an inline file whose 300-byte attribute is in a block whose
first entry's value offset was set to 0xFFFF: unpatched, the read hung;
patched, the read is refused and the session goes on.

**The fix:** release `&ref->block`.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `18ddc30`. Its one hunk fails on master,
and it is not needed there.

### Patch 35 -- the directory iterator cannot report a read error

**Where:** `include/ext4.h` (`ext4_dir.last_err`), `src/ext4.c`
(`ext4_dir_open`, `ext4_dir_entry_next`).

**The defect:** `ext4_dir_entry_next` returned NULL both at the end and when
the directory's inode or a block could not be read, and ignored
`ext4_dir_iterator_next`'s result -- so a damaged directory listed as
complete, or as empty.

**Shown:** a directory whose extent points past the filesystem: unpatched,
it listed as empty with success; patched, the listing fails, and the
directory beside it lists all its entries.

**The fix:** the failures set `d->last_err` and end the walk; the entry
already copied is still returned; `ext4_dir_open` clears it. A caller
checks it once its loop has ended.

**Upstream:** no issue found. Not fixed in master (it still ignores the
iterator's result). 2 of its 4 hunks need adapting to master.

### Patch 36 -- an assertion spins for ever, and data reaches several

**Where:** `include/ext4_debug.h`, `src/ext4_debug.c` (the macro), and the
assertion sites in `ext4_fs.c`, `ext4.c`, `ext4_dir.h` / `ext4_dir.c`,
`ext4_dir_idx.c`, `ext4_extent.c`, `ext4_xattr.c`, `ext4_bcache.c`,
`ext4_blockdev.h` / `ext4_blockdev.c`, `ext4_mkfs.c`, `ext4_journal.h` /
`ext4_journal.c`.

**The defect:** lwext4's own `ext4_assert` prints and loops `while (1)`,
and data reaches it. `ext4_fs_correspond_inode_mode` knew only directory,
file and symlink, so ANY path walk through a folder holding a device node,
a FIFO or a socket (OpenWrt's 0,0 whiteouts, a running system's sockets)
spun; `ext4_dir_write_entry` did the same when renaming one, and on an
oversize length; a directory with a HOLE spun in the extent lookup, and on
a block-mapped directory every reader read block 0 as a directory block and
the add-entry scan WROTE a name into it; every walk over a directory block
stepped by an unchecked `rec_len`, and a 0 never advanced. The other sites
guard a caller's arguments, lwext4's own bookkeeping, or I/O and memory
failures in the journal -- each also a spin.

**Shown:** an image with device nodes, a FIFO, a socket and a whiteout:
listing hung unpatched; patched, list, stat, rename and remove work,
`e2fsck` clean. A directory with a hole: hung unpatched; patched, refused,
block 0 untouched. Entries with a record length of 0: hung unpatched;
patched, every walk refused, none spins.

**The fix:** every assertion is an error return its callers handle (EINVAL
for a broken precondition, EIO for damage, ENOMEM), the calls that were
inside assertions are made outside them and checked; both type maps cover
all seven kinds, and an entry that does not say is resolved from the inode;
a new `ext4_dir_en_len_bad` refuses a `rec_len` under 12, off the 4-byte
step or past the block in every walk; a lookup that may not return a hole
refuses one (EIO); `ext4_dir_write_entry`, `ext4_block_set_lb_size`,
`jbd_add_revoke_block_tags` and `jbd_build_revoke_tree` return int; the
journal gains a sticky fault (a checkpoint that cannot read or allocate
stops, and the journal stop returns the fault with needs_recovery left set,
so the transactions are replayed later); the macro records its site
(`ext4_assert_record` / `_last` / `_clear`) and continues. Fixed on the
way: a failed htree insert after a leaf split reported success; a damaged
block's lookup went on to the next block; the in-block insert cut its
neighbour before writing.

**Upstream:** no issue found. Not fixed in master (the same macro, the same
three-type maps). 17 of its 94 hunks need adapting to master.

### Patch 37 -- a multi-block free neither revokes nor invalidates its blocks

**Where:** `src/ext4_balloc.c`, `ext4_balloc_free_blocks`.

**The defect:** the group loop consumes `count` and advances `first`, and
the revoke loop and `ext4_bcache_invalidate_lba` after it use those same
variables -- so the revoke loop runs zero times and the invalidation covers
nothing. A block freed this way stays in the journal unrevoked and in the
cache: when it held journaled metadata (a directory's blocks) and a file is
then written into it, the stale cached blocks are written back over the
file at the next checkpoint, and after a crash the replay writes them over
it again. `e2fsck` sees nothing wrong. The closing `ext4_assert(count ==
0)` passed BECAUSE of the defect.

**Shown:** a journaled image: 120 long names in a new folder, the folder
removed, 96 KiB imported into the space, one session: unpatched, the file
held 8 192 wrong bytes after a clean close and 16 384 after a crash and
replay, `e2fsck` clean; patched, none.

**The fix:** the start of the range is kept; the revoke and the
invalidation cover exactly the blocks freed; the loop's own failure is
returned. (A failure inside the loop still returns at once without revoking
the groups already freed -- Part 2.)

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `9dc5fd9` (the revoke), `faa76ad` and
`47bbb86` (the invalidation). 1 of its 2 hunks fails on master, and it is
not needed there.

### Patch 38 -- an aborted transaction leaves the superblock's free counts lowered

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `__ext4_trans_abort` and a new
`ext4_trans_abort_recount`.

**The defect:** an abort drops the transaction's journaled bitmaps and
group descriptors, but the allocator had already lowered the SUPERBLOCK's
free counts in memory, and the superblock is written at unmount outside the
journal -- so after a write that failed for lack of space the superblock's
free blocks stay short of the groups' sum.

**Shown:** a write larger than the free space, then the superblock's free
count against the groups' sum: 10800 / 10805 unpatched, 10805 / 10805
patched.

**The fix:** after the abort, the superblock's free blocks and free inodes
are set to the groups' sums (a group that cannot be read leaves them).

**Upstream:** no issue found. Not fixed in master; applies to master with
fuzz.

### Patch 39 -- listing a directory over-reads its block's buffer

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `ext4_dir_entry_next`.

**The defect:** each entry was copied with `memcpy(&d->de, it.curr,
sizeof(ext4_direntry))` -- 263 bytes, a 255-byte name -- whatever its real
length, so an entry starting in a block's last 262 bytes was read from past
the buffer's end: a heap over-read on most listings, which faults only when
the buffer ends at an unmapped page.

**Shown:** a 1 KiB-block directory with eight entries in the last 262 bytes
of its first block (the last copied read 199 bytes past the block): 4
crashes in 300 runs unpatched, none in 1 000 patched.

**The fix:** only the 8-byte header and the name
(`ext4_dir_en_get_name_len`, held to 255) are copied, over a zeroed entry.
Copying the record length instead was rejected: it can exceed the struct.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `a84a1b6`. 1 of its 2 hunks fails on
master, and it is not needed there.

### Patch 40 -- a damaged journal superblock crashes a writable mount

**Where:** `src/ext4_journal.c`, `jbd_get_fs`, its two failure exits.

**The defect:** each exit cleared the whole `jbd_fs` -- its `inode_ref`
with it -- and THEN called `ext4_fs_put_inode_ref(&jbd_fs->inode_ref)`,
which follows the now-null filesystem pointer.

**Shown:** an ext4 whose journal superblock's magic was zeroed: unpatched,
an access violation on a writable mount; patched, the mount is refused
(EIO).

**The fix:** the reference is given back first, then the structure cleared.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `dd3f008`. Its one hunk fails on master,
and it is not needed there.

### Patch 41 -- a journal replay leaves the superblock's free counts stale

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`, `__ext4_recover`.

**The defect:** a replay restores the groups' descriptors and bitmaps but
not the superblock's free block and inode counts, which the Linux driver
writes lazily -- stale after a crash. lwext4 adjusts them from there and
writes them at unmount: "Free blocks count wrong".

**Shown:** the superblock's free count lowered by 100 with a harmless
transaction pending: unpatched, after lwext4's replay `e2fsck` "Free blocks
count wrong (6542, counted=6642)"; patched, clean.

**The fix:** after a recovery on a writable mount, both counts are summed
from the groups, with patch 38's recount.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `2e93de2`. Applies to master with fuzz,
and is not needed there.

### Patch 42 -- the journal's escape flag is mishandled, and a replay destroys the superblock

**Where:** `src/ext4_journal.c`: `struct tag_info`, `jbd_extract_block_tag`,
`jbd_write_block_tag`, `jbd_iterate_block_table` and its callbacks,
`jbd_replay_block_tags`, `jbd_journal_prepare`.

**The defect:** jbd2 logs a block whose first four bytes are the journal
magic with those bytes zeroed and `JBD_FLAG_ESCAPE` on its tag. Reading
such a tag, lwext4 set the block NUMBER to 0, which the replay takes for
the superblock's block: the logged block's bytes from offset 1024 became
the superblock, and the block itself was never restored. Writing, lwext4
never escaped, so a logged block beginning with the magic (a bitmap can)
reads to any scan as a journal block.

**Shown:** a pending transaction logging a block beginning with the magic,
escaped: unpatched, after lwext4's replay `e2fsck` reported "Bad magic
number in super-block" and the block was not restored; patched, the block
is restored and the image clean -- as e2fsck's own replay of a copy gives.
The write side is by reading.

**The fix:** the tag keeps its number and carries an `is_escape` flag,
passed to the replay, which writes the magic back; `jbd_journal_prepare`
escapes a block that begins with the magic, its checksum taken over the
copy as logged, as jbd2's is.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `384424b` and `fb6fd61`. 4 of its 15 hunks
fail on master, and it is not needed there.

### Patch 43 -- on 1 KiB blocks a replay's superblock is overwritten by the pre-replay one

**Where:** `src/ext4_journal.c`, `jbd_recover`.

**The defect:** `jbd_recover` ends by writing the in-memory superblock with
the recovery flag cleared -- the copy read at mount, BEFORE the replay. On
2 and 4 KiB blocks the superblock is in block 0, whose replay branch copies
the logged superblock into memory, so the write carries it; on 1 KiB blocks
it is block 1, replayed to the device through the ordinary path, and the
write then puts the pre-replay superblock back over it.

**Shown:** a pending transaction logging the superblock's block with a new
label: at 1 KiB, unpatched, the old label after lwext4's replay (e2fsck's
replay gives the new one); at 4 KiB the new one either way; patched, the
new one at both.

**The fix:** after a successful replay the cache is flushed and the
superblock read back, keeping the mount's own mount count and state.

**Upstream:** not fixed in master (the same write-back); applies to master.

### Patch 44 -- writing attributes back corrupts a SHARED xattr block

**Where:** `src/ext4_xattr.c`, `ext4_xattr_write_to_disk`.

**The defect:** four, all in the write-back that `ext4_fs_put_xattr_ref`
runs. (1) A shared block (`h_refcount` above 1) was rewritten in place as
this inode's alone, `h_refcount` set to 1: the other inodes saw this one's
attributes, and the next free of the block freed it under them. (2) The
block was not cleared, so a set that shrank kept its old trailing entries.
(3) No entry hash was computed. (4) When the set moved wholly into the
inode, a shared block's lowered count was not re-signed and the inode's
`i_blocks` still counted it.

**Shown:** two inodes whose 200-byte attributes are in blocks, one block
shared with a third inode, each attribute set rewritten: unpatched,
`e2fsck` "Extended attribute block has reference count 1, should be 2";
patched, the inode moved to a block of its own, every attribute in place,
clean. (2) and (3) were not shown by `e2fsck` on that image.

**The fix:** a shared block is copied -- a new block for this inode first,
then the old one's count lowered, re-signed and let go, `i_blocks` adjusted
(a failed allocation leaves everything as it was); the block is cleared
before it is laid out; each entry's hash is computed; (4) re-signs and
adjusts `i_blocks`.

**Upstream:** fixed in master: the hash by `5372f03`, the clear by
`9fdd0b7`, and the rest by master's rewrite of the module (`278e8d4`, GPL
since `b1a34c5`). Applies to master with fuzz, and is not needed there.

### Patch 45 -- a freed block goes unrevoked, and a revoked block reused as metadata is lost

**Where:** `src/ext4_journal.c`, `jbd_trans_try_revoke_block` and the end
of `jbd_trans_set_block_dirty`.

**The defect:** two. (1) A missed revoke: when a transaction dirties a
block an older one logged, the older buffer is flushed and the block's
record moves to the new transaction; if that transaction then FREES the
block, `jbd_trans_try_revoke_block` found the record its own and wrote no
revoke -- while the older transaction, still in the log until the log's
start passes it, held the block's old content. A crash then, and the next
replay lays the old copy over the block's next owner (file data, silently).
(2) A revoke not cancelled: a block freed and reallocated as metadata in
ONE transaction carried both its revoke and its new content, and jbd2's
replay (e2fsck's, the Linux driver's) replays a block only from a
transaction after its revoke's, so it drops the new content.

**By reading:** neither was made to fail by a test.

**The fix:** (1) a freed block is revoked whenever a journal record for it
exists, whichever transaction owns it now. (2) dirtying a block in a
transaction removes and frees that transaction's revoke of it.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `8281a97` (both points) and `321eba3`
(freeing the cancelled record) -- bar one case: master's
`jbd_trans_try_revoke_block` revokes an own-record block only while the
older buffer is still unwritten, so an older copy already written in place
but still in the log goes unrevoked; this patch revokes there too. Applies
to master with fuzz. (Master's `13875d2`, which aligns lwext4's replay with
jbd2's revoke rule, must not be taken without (2).)

### Patch 46 -- transaction IDs are compared without their wrap past 2^32

**Where:** `src/ext4_journal.c`: a new `trans_id_diff`; the revoke test in
`jbd_replay_block_tags`; the stop test and the last ID in
`jbd_iterate_log`.

**The defect:** jbd2 transaction IDs are 32-bit sequence numbers that run
past 2^32 to 0, and e2fsck gives a journal it resets a random starting
sequence, so a log can begin near the top. Three places ordered IDs with
plain `<` / `>`: a log whose transactions cross the wrap -- one pending
transaction numbered 0xFFFFFFFF is enough -- was scanned to a last ID of
0, the replay stopped at its first transaction, NOTHING was replayed and
the committed changes were lost; a revoke across the wrap was misjudged.

**Shown:** one pending transaction, ID 0xFFFFFFFF, logging the superblock
with a new label: unpatched, the old label after lwext4's replay; patched,
the new one, `e2fsck` clean -- as e2fsck's own replay gives.

**The fix:** the difference taken as a signed 32-bit number, at all three.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `bc6e18d` and `ea294e2`. All 4 of its
hunks fail on master, and it is not needed there.

### Patch 47 -- a new inode is not zeroed

**Where:** `src/ext4_fs.c`, `ext4_fs_alloc_inode`.

**The defect:** the named fields were set and the rest of the slot kept
what the freed inode had, and the inode free clears the xattr BLOCK pointer
but not the in-inode attribute area -- so a file made in a freed slot
inherited the old file's creation time, project id and in-inode attributes
(an ACL, a security label). With lwext4's own `extra_isize` (28: its
`struct ext4_inode` ends before `i_projid`) against the Linux driver's 32,
the inherited attribute is hidden rather than gone, and reappears when
`extra_isize` is grown.

**Shown:** a file with a user attribute in its inode body, removed, and a
new file made in its slot: a raw dump of the slot showed the old
attribute's header and value still there, behind the new `extra_isize`,
with the old creation time; patched, none of it.

**The fix:** the whole slot (`inode_size` bytes) is zeroed before the
fields are set.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `8163730`. Applies to master with fuzz,
and is not needed there.

### Patch 48 -- a creating open's transaction nests inside its caller's

**Where:** `src/ext4.c`: `ext4_generic_open2`, `ext4_generic_open`,
`ext4_fopen2`, `ext4_dir_mk`, `ext4_fsymlink`.

**The defect:** `ext4_generic_open2` started a transaction for an
`O_CREAT` open and stopped it at its end. A start does nothing while a
transaction is open, but a stop always commits, so inside `ext4_fsymlink`
(and `ext4_dir_mk`), which open their own first, the open's stop COMMITTED
the caller's transaction: the link's target was then written with no
transaction, and the caller's abort on a failure aborted nothing. And its
failure exit after the path walk returned without ending the transaction it
had started.

**By reading:** the window is inside one call.

**The fix (master's scopes):** `ext4_generic_open2` opens no transaction;
`ext4_generic_open` and `ext4_fopen2` open one around a creating open,
committed on success and aborted on failure; `ext4_dir_mk`'s own is
removed; `ext4_fsymlink`'s one transaction covers the inode, the entry and
the target, inside the write-back window.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `9b38aef`. 6 of its 10 hunks fail on
master, and it is not needed there.

### Patch 49 -- a failed bitmap write leaks a group descriptor reference

**Where:** `src/ext4_balloc.c`, `ext4_balloc_alloc_block`, the two bitmap
writes in the goal's group.

**The defect:** when writing the bitmap block failed, those two exits
returned without giving the group descriptor's reference back. By reading:
an I/O error only.

**The fix:** each gives the reference back first, as the function's other
exits do.

**Upstream:** issue #57; fixed in master by `2248e43` (pull request #58).
1 of its 2 hunks fails on master, and it is not needed there.

### Patch 50 -- a missing path level is hashed and named with the rest of the path

**Where:** `src/ext4_dir_idx.c`, `ext4_dir_dx_add_entry` (and its
declaration); its call in `src/ext4_dir.c`.

**The defect:** the name's length was taken as `strlen(name)`. A create
whose path has a missing level (`ext4_generic_open2` makes it as a
directory) hands in a pointer into the whole path, so for the level "nodir"
of "/nodir/sub" the length ran on to "nodir/sub": in an indexed directory
the entry was hashed on, and written with, the rest of the path.

**Shown:** a root of 400 long names indexed by `e2fsck -D`, then a create of
"/nodir/sub": unpatched ENOSPC, nothing made; patched, both levels made and
`e2fsck -fn` (which checks the index's hash order) clean.

**The fix:** the caller's length is passed through.

**Upstream:** fixed in master by `1aa9740`. All 4 of its hunks fail on
master, and it is not needed there.

### Patch 51 -- a transaction's revokes are a list

**Where:** `include/ext4_journal.h` (`struct jbd_revoke_rec`, `struct
jbd_trans`); `src/ext4_journal.c` (the transaction's revoke functions).

**What it is:** a cost, not a wrong result. With patch 45 every block a
transaction dirties looks for its own revoke to cancel; in a list that is a
walk of all of them, and a large delete revokes thousands, so the work grew
as their square. A block revoked twice was also recorded twice.

**The change:** the revokes are an RB tree keyed by block, as master keeps
them: a lookup finds the block's record or none, a second revoke adds
nothing, and the log's revoke block lists them in block order.

**Upstream:** master's own shape (`358f3f8` for the duplicate). 7 of its 9
hunks fail on master, which does not need it.

Two later corrections belong to patch 7's own new code (`ext4_inline.c`)
and apply only with it: an inline size is checked before it sizes a buffer,
an inline directory's entries are held to the block, a conversion can no
longer empty the inode; and dropping an inline inode whose "system.data"
attribute is missing is allowed.

| The commit block's v1 checksum branch tests `JBD_FEATURE_COMPAT_CHECKSUM` in the INCOMPAT word (where 0x1 is REVOKE), and the v1 sum it writes is a little-endian crc32 where jbd2's is big-endian. v2 / v3 overwrite those fields, so it matters only to a v1 checksummed journal. | `ext4_journal.c`, `jbd_trans_write_commit_block` | reading | master `d1f4f6d` / `6176f0a` write the header fields as bytes |
| The prepend merge lowers a leaf's first extent's `first_block` without correcting the index above it, so in a tree of depth 1 or more the parent index keeps the old, higher start (e2fsck: "Logical start does not match logical start at next level"). Needs a write before a file's first extent landing just before it physically. | `ext4_extent.c`, `ext4_ext_insert_leaf` | reading | in master too |
| Reading in-inode attributes takes `extra_isize` unbounded and walks the inode body on a remainder only a zero word stops, so a damaged inode can make it read past the inode. | `ext4_xattr.c`, `ext4_xattr_inode_fetch` | reading | in master's rewrite too |
| A removal that ends INSIDE an extent keeps a zero-length tail (`len` cut before `new_len` is taken from it). Reached only by a truncate to a size inside an extent; lwext4's own truncate always removes to the end. | `ext4_extent.c`, `ext4_ext_remove_leaf` | reading | fixed in master (`dbcf993`) |
| Block 0's index in its group is computed wrongly on a 1 KiB-block volume; harmless, as no allocation goal or freed block is ever 0. | `ext4_fs.h`, `ext4_fs_addr_to_idx_bg` | reading | fixed in master (`af50342`) |
| The xattr name parser accepts an ACL name that is a whole prefix (`system.posix_acl_access`) as a prefix. Reached only through lwext4's xattr API. | `ext4_xattr.c`, `ext4_extract_xattr_name` | reading | fixed in master (`b088876`) |

## Part 3 -- upstream issues that are not lwext4 defects

| Issue | What it is |
|---|---|
| #42 | a MinGW build error in upstream's demo program (`inet_pton`), not in the library |
| #48, #66 | install and packaging |
| #53, #56 | a usage question; a request for examples |
| #55, #73, #82 | logical MBR partitions, MBR CHS values, GPT: lwext4's optional `ext4_mbr.c` |
| #59 | macOS support |
| #60 | partial `ext4_readlink` with a short buffer: the caller sizes its buffer |
| #75 | an offset for upstream's demo file device |
| #79, #83 | concurrency: lwext4 is not thread-safe, by design |
